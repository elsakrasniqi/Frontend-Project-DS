            <p>
                Flight into Egypt: Black Artists and Ancient Egypt, 1876–Now examines how Black artists and other
                cultural figures have
                engaged with ancient Egypt through visual art, sculpture, literature, music, scholarship, religion,
                politics, and
                performance. In a multisensory exploration of nearly 150 years of artistic and cultural production—from
                the 19th century
                to the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s to the present day—the
                exhibition includes
                nearly 200 works of art in a wide range of media.

                Thematic sections featuring works from The Met collection and international loans from public and
                private collections
                trace subjects including how Black artists and other agents of culture have employed ancient Egyptian
                imagery to craft a
                unifying identity, the contributions of Black scholars to the study of ancient Egypt, and the engagement
                of modern and
                contemporary Egyptian artists with ancient Egypt.

                In a first for The Met, performance will be an integral part of the exhibition itself in the form of a dedicated
                gallery. Organized in collaboration with MetLiveArts, the “Performance Pyramid” will both present a documentary history
                of Black performance art incorporating ancient Egyptian themes and host live performances on select days throughout the
                run of the exhibition.

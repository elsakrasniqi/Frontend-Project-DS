            <h2>About the Event</h2>
            <p>
                Siena: The Rise of Painting, 1300–1350 examines an exceptional moment at the dawn of the Italian Renaissance and the
                pivotal role of Sienese artists—including Duccio, Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and Simone Martini—in defining Western
                painting. In the decades leading up to the catastrophic onset of the plague around 1350, Siena was the site of
                phenomenal artistic innovation and activity. While Florence is often positioned as the center of the Renaissance, this
                presentation offers a fresh perspective on the importance of Siena, from Duccio’s profound influence on a new generation
                of painters to the development of narrative altarpieces and the dissemination of artistic styles beyond Italy.

                Drawing on the outstanding collections of The Met and the National Gallery, London, as well as rare loans from dozens of
                other major lenders, the exhibition will include more than 100 works by a remarkable group of Sienese artists. It will
                feature paintings alongside sculptures, metalwork, and textiles, ranging from large works made for public display to
                intimate objects created for private devotion. Although none of these artists survived the plague of circa 1350, their
                achievements had an immeasurable impact on painters and theorists in the centuries that followed.

                The exhibition is made possible by the Sherman Fairchild Foundation, Alice Cary Brown and W.L. Lyons Brown, the Gail and
                Parker Gilbert Fund, and the Diane W. and James E. Burke Fund.
